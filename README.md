#  **LANDMARKS ON FACES FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS**

Domain adaptation approach based on a two-step learning to
detect fiducial points on human and animal faces.

This method builds a landmark detector
by performing two tasks: 

    i: Learning to identify landmarks
    in a supervised way by using labeled data of human faces
    (source domain)

    ii: Learning to reconstruct non-human
    faces with unlabeled data (target domain).
