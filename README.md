#  **LANDMARKS ON FACES FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS**

Domain adaptation approach based on a two-step learning to
detect fiducial points on human and animal faces.

This method builds a landmark detector
by performing two tasks: 

1: Learning to identify landmarks
in a supervised way by using labeled data of human faces
(source domain)

2: Learning to reconstruct non-human
faces with unlabeled data (target domain).
